# By grace, I was led from a quasi-Christian sect to the Faith of our Fathers.

## Here is my purpose.
I share [my Catholic comments]({{< ref "/page/blog/" >}}) with anyone who's interested. Composing my thoughts in writing is one way for me to process my spiritual journey -- my highs and my lows -- to appreciate where I've been and where I'm going, and to do so with humility and thanksgiving.

It's a way for me to live soberly in view of the "Four Last Things" -- Death, Judgment, Heaven, and Hell -- and to prepare for the most important hour of my life: *the hour of my death*.

My hope is for all of us -- no matter our background -- to attain heaven, which is to see God face to face, sharing in his divine life with perfect happiness and perfect fulfillment for all eternity. That's why I try to cultivate a Catholic conscience (and to share it with others), because to do anything else is insane.

Questions? Comments? Suggestions?
[Let me know.]({{< ref "/page/contact/" >}})
