## My reason for blogging.
Composing my thoughts for [this blog]({{< ref "/page/blog/" >}}) is one way for me to process my spiritual journey -- my highs and my lows -- to appreciate where I've been and where I'm going, attempting to share both critiques and explanations with humility and charity.

My hope is for all of us -- no matter our background -- to attain heaven, which is to see God face to face, sharing in his divine life with perfect happiness and perfect fulfillment for all eternity. It's with this goal that I try to cultivate a Catholic conscience (and share it however I can), because to do otherwise is insane.
