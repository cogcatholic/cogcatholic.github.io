      <description>I first heard the question, &amp;ldquo;Could Jesus have sinned?&amp;rdquo; in the early 1990s. The leadership of the Worldwide Church of God (WCG) was making the point that Jesus was never tempted to sin, but rather was tested.&#xA;According to the popular usage of these words, they were absolutely right. Jesus did not endure temptation in the sense of resisting a strong urge to sin and only succeeding by the skin of his teeth.</description>

      <description>Can we apply the label &amp;ldquo;Christian&amp;rdquo; to the various COGs in the Armstrong tradition, such as the United Church of God (UCG); Church of God, a Worldwide Association (COGWA); Church of God International (CGI); Intercontinental Church of God (ICG); and all the rest?&#xA;We surely agree that the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (think Mormons) and The Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society (think Jehovah&amp;rsquo;s Witnesses) are not Christian.</description>
